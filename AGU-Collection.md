**Submission Open: 1 September 2022**

**Submission Deadline: 31 December 2023**

A web-based collection of JWST Solar System papers in [JGR-Planets](https://jgr-planets-submit.agu.org/), [JGR-Space Physics](https://jgr-spacephysics-submit.agu.org/), and [Geophysical Research Letters](https://grl-submit.agu.org/).  The latter is ideal for short-format and high-impact papers.

### Special Collection Organizers:
* Leigh N. Fletcher, University of Leicester
* Heidi Hammel, AURA
* Imke de Pater, UC Berkeley
* Stefanie Milam, NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center
* Thierry Fouchet, Observatoire de Paris

### Background 
JWST will provide unprecedented new insights into numerous Solar System targets during its first year of science operations. Scheduled observations will target the Giant Planets and their active satellites; Mars’s atmosphere; dwarf planets from Centaurs to the Kuiper Belt; asteroids and comets; and even potential interstellar objects. Results are expected to span planetary origins, atmospheres, magnetospheres, surfaces, and more. JWST can track moving targets, and its instruments provide opportunities for spatially-resolved spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, aperture-masked interferometry, and more. Furthermore, JWST infrared datasets will be supported by observatories operating on the ground and in space, providing novel datasets that can be combined with JWST data. This AGU special collection will bring together a diverse set of scientific discoveries and techniques, enabled by the Guaranteed Time, Early-Release, and Guest Observer science observations during Cycle 1, as a resource for the community making use of JWST in future cycles.

### Instructions for Authors
The collection will open for submissions on September 1, 2022 and will close on December 31, 2023. We encourage authors to act in a timely manner and remain responsive throughout the review process. Authors should submit through the submission portals below. When authors submit a manuscript, they should select the collection’s title from the dropdown menu in the Special Collection field of the submission form.
 
Please review the [AGU data policy](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors) and information on [unpublished references](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Text-requirements#:~:text=Every%20reference%20must%20be%20available,described%20in%20the%20Availability%20Statement.), and note that submitted manuscripts may cite other pending (in prep/submitted/in revision) submissions to the collection and that the corresponding authors should upload drafts of any unpublished work they cite under the “Related Manuscript” file type for peer review. We also encourage the use of the preprint server ESSOAr to publish preprints of manuscripts that reference each other, which relieves authors of uploading drafts of unpublished references as part of their submission package. (There is a 1-click transfer option to ESSOAr on our submission site.) 
 
To submit your manuscript, use the submission site for [JGR-Planets](https://jgr-planets-submit.agu.org/), [JGR-Space Physics](https://jgr-spacephysics-submit.agu.org/), and [Geophysical Research Letters](https://grl-submit.agu.org/), and select the collection’s title from the drop down menu in the Special Section field of the submission form.
