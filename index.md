New information repository for Giant Planet observations from James Webb Space Telescope.  Within this directory, you'll find pages describing the observation strategies for all four giant planets, as well as the APT files for the submissions.

This work is primarily based on two programmes:
* Early Release Science observations (ERS, PI: Imke de Pater and Thierry Fouchet)
* Guaranteed Time observations (GTO, PI: Leigh Fletcher on behalf of Interdisciplinary Scientist Heidi Hammel).

These pages are assembled based on contributions from the entire GTO and ERS teams, along with program coordinators at Space Telescope.

All data from these programmes will be publically available as soon as they are on the ground.
